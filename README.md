# GitPractice

This Repository has been created to practice different commands of git commands

## What we have done here

We have used different commands in order to practice the commands and for that I have followed the instruction of  [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git). And there I have found a [cheatsheet](https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:8132028b-024f-4b6b-953e-e68fcce0c5fa/atlassian-git-cheatsheet.pdf) which was kind of helpful for me.
